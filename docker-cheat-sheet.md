# Docker Cheat Sheet

Containers use an **isolated filesystem** provided by a container image. 

A **container image** contains everything needed to run an application (i.e. dependencies, scripts, binaries, environment variables, defauly command to run, metadata, etc.)

A ** Dockerfile** is a test-based script of instructions used to create a container image.
